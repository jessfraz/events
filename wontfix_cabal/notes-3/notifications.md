# Managing your GitHub notifications
- feel like things sometimes move so fast sometimes that you need to jump in immediately or you'll fall behind
- can take a long time to collect context of everything that's happened on a particular issue/PR when you do jump in
- contributors who receive quick responses are more likely to become maintainers but that puts pressure on maintainers to keep up with things
- maintenance mode takes more time than writing the project and keeping track of notifications is hard
- new contributors aren't always familiar with the language the project is written in so it can take a long time to get their work mergeable
- sometimes just declare bankruptcy and mark all notifications as read but then you lose track of things that are ready
- "I'm the only person who cares enough to do anything about it"
- [Octobox](https://octobox.io) is a tool built for managing your GitHub Notifications
- You can have bots on the issue tracker to mark things as stale e.g. https://github.com/apps/probot-stale
- Unticking the watch button on GitHub
- Some people use tools to sync GitHub Issues with other tools but then you can have two sets of notifications to check rather than one
- First-time contributor PRs can take a lot longer to review
- Buckets for Direct Mentions, Team Mentions, Author, per-repo buckets
- There's a variety of different approaches on whether things should be open/closed: do you keep open issues based on whether they are going to be working on, reproducible, etc.
- There's a difference between issues and support requests
- Desire for a TODO list that only people who have commit access can push to
- Milestones are a way of creating a self-managed TODO list or assignments or issues labels
